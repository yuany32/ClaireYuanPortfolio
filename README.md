## Hello! This is the repository for my past works and projects

## Human Memory Research 
### **I am not allowed to publish the data and codes that I used because of this is still an ongoing research. 
### I used Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, plotly) and R(ggplot2, dplyr, gridExtra, readxl) for data analysis and visualizations for the project.  
### presentation slides I created to present my findings: [lab presentation.pdf](https://github.com/yuany32/ClaireYuanPortfolio/blob/main/lab%20presentation.pdf)
